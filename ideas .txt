---------
issue machines over hoppers do not drain inventory anymore.
Found out why its happening but not a fix yet. It seems that when i switched from using the normal IInventory for the machines over to using forge's new capability system it broke the interactions with vanilla hoppers for entities. Will need to research it more on how /if it can be fixed.
possible work around . Unloader.
